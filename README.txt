This is a wrapper class for the wonderful service https://erikberg.com/api

There are 2 projects contained here XMLStats4Net which is the wrapper class library and DemoApp which is a console app to demonstrate the use of the class library.

There are more Methods than those implemented in this project but they should be fairly straight forward to implement.

To use this project you will need to sign up for an account at https://erikberg.com/api and obtain an API key.   Once you have the key you can place it in the Console App string and define your own user Agent.   The user agent can be any string and is just something unique to identify yourself to the service.    

There are request limits / rate limits that you should understand before using this library.   You can read more about them at https://erikberg.com/api

This project isn't affilitated with https://erikberg.com/api at all.
